# CSS Grid Ask Me Anything

I've been working with, writing and speaking about the CSS Grid Layout specification for around 4 years now. I get a lot of questions about how to use the spec via Twitter and email and so end up answering the same thing a number of times.

This project means I can answer things once and benefit more people!

## Guidelines

1. I will answer questions about CSS Grid Layout and related specifications.
2. To ask a question raise an Issue
3. Answered questions can be viewed by looking at the closed issues
4. Try and keep questions to single things, eg: "how do I build this entire application layout?" is probably not something I'm going to answer, whereas "Here is an illustration of a component, how do I get these boxes to all be the same height?" is.
5. A CodePen/gist/jsbin example if you have a code issue or a illustration (however rough) will _really help_.

Some frequently asked questions.

## Where did this come from?

This project started due to a [Twitter conversation](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew/status/793917607787184128). I thought it would be fun to do a workshop type thing where peope ask me stuff about CSS Grid Layout and I build examples to answer the questions. Stuart Robson suggested the AMA format, and so here we are.
